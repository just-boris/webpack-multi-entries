## Multi-entry webpack demo

This branch is using webpack 5 (does not work)

## Getting started

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Check http://localhost:8080/foo/main and http://localhost:8080/bar/main to see different output (they do not work, only http://localhost:8080/main is resolved to a single compilation)
